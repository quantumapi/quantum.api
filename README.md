## 4. Basic Usage

Below is a minimal example demonstrating how **Quantum.API** is intended to work in Python. It shows how you can instantiate a quantum session, pass parameters, and receive advanced computational results:

```python
# ====================================
# QUANTUM.API :: DEMO USAGE
# ====================================

import quantum_api
from quantum_api.invocation import QuantumSummon

# Establish a secure quantum channel
with QuantumSummon(channel="QIP-X") as q:
    # Fork this function across parallel realities
    result = q.invoke(
        function="predict_future",
        parameters={
            "timeline_variance": 0.42,  # Example chaos factor
            "precompute": True,         # Simulated time-folding
            "entropy_stabilization": "adaptive"  # Prevent decoherence
        }
    )

print("Multiversal Prediction:", result)
```

1. **Import** the modules.
2. **Open** a `QuantumSummon` context with your specified channel.
3. **Invoke** the function, passing in parameters.
4. **Print** or store the result.

> **Note:** The codebase continues to evolve. Keep an eye out for updates that expand on quantum simulation and real hardware integrations.
